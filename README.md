# AiiDA Enhancement Proposals (AEPs)

This repository contains enhancement proposals for [AiiDA](https://www.aiida.net) (AiiDA enhancement proposals = AEPs).
It is similar to [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) of the Python core language but less 'formalized' and closer to the way the [Jupyter project](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals) deals with enhancement proposals.

The purpose is to publicly discuss new features & design choices in the AiiDA ecosystem and to document the decision making process.

Accepted AEPs can be easily browsed and read on the [online documentation](https://aep.readthedocs.io/) or directly on this repository through the index below.
