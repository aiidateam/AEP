# AiiDA Enhancement Proposals (AEPs)

This repository contains enhancement proposals for [AiiDA](www.aiida.net) (AiiDA
enhancement proposals = AEPs), similar to
[PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) of the python core language but
less 'formalized' and closer to the way the [Jupyter project deals
with enhancement proposals](https://github.com/jupyter/enhancement-proposals).

The purpose is to publicly discuss new features & design choices in the AiiDA
ecosystem and to document the decision making process.
